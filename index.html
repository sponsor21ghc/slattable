<h1 style = "text-align: center">Throwing Together a Slat table:</h1>


<div style="font-size: 25px">
	<p>You have to throw together a slat table, and this slat table is going to have a base dimension of 16 inches long, by 14 inches wide.  The base (mounted to the wall at an angle) will be at ones navel (the base edge -- at the navel)  If one draws a "normal" out from ones self, the table will angle upward from there at roghly a 45 degree angle.  Nuff said.
</p>

	<p>The Horizontal slat will stick out over this "lowest edge" base area (referenced from the left edge of the table) by 8 inches.  Clarification might be helpful here so, to reword, this base area slat will lay directly on the slat table surface at it's navel base area, and will protrude out over the navel-edge, by 8 inches.  This base slat is constrianed by these same dimensions as a regular slat (only 3 total slats for this table anyway), but is only about 8 inches in length.  The long axis of this slat will be parallel with the base / navel edge of this "45 degree leaning" table, and said slat will be laying FLAT on this table surface (slat dimensions to be discussed in detail later).  This 8 inch slat is NOT laying on one of it's edges, but, is laying FLAT.
</p>

	<p>At the center of this slat-table shortest slat area, one will place a 2 by 2 stub.  Said stub will rest on the very right edge of this 8 inch slat.  The purpose of this short stub 2 by 2, is to provide structure onto which the vertical slat will be mounted.  The 2 by 2 stub, is mostly, in the very center of the slat table surface (all of these slats, are setting up structural "availability' for the next slat in this 3-slat-assembly sequence).	
</p>

	<p>The long axis of this 2 by 2 stub, will be purpendicular to the long axis of the aforementioned 8 inch base slat.  Said 2 by 2 simply provides structure for which to mount the number 2 slat (the vertical slat).  The vertical slat has it's edge facing one's navel (the EDGE is facing one's navel, NOT the FLAT AREA surface).	
</p>

	<p>The cross (and final) slat is next.  It will be smashed into roughly the same plane as the vertical slat, but will be purpendicur (cross slat departs away from one's navel / chest area purpendicular to one's vertical profile.  One's vertical profile could be roughly drawn from nose to toes, and this cross slat departs at a normal to the vertical profile line (and / or plane).  Both the vertical and the cross slat (while pupendicular to each other), are laying (roughly) in the same plane.	
</p>

	<p>Just like the short "initial" slat, the cross slat departs in a purpendicular fashion, away from it's previous slat.	
</p>

	<p>This 3 piece "slat entity", forms the framework onto which the vision unit can be mounted.  Horizontal / cross slat will be 12 and 3/8 inches up off of this slat table (16 inches by 14 inches) working surface.	
</p>

	<p>From the vertical slat navel / chest edge, the vision unit will be mounted 5 inches in from the edge.  The vertical slat is not precisely represented in a true vertical fasion, but, perhaps some sense of what is being described here can be envisioned (horizontal slat, then verical slat, and finally, cross slat --- 8 inches in form edge, 12 and 3/8 inches up from flat surface, 5 inches in from the edge).  All of this verbeage is assembled in and effort to establish this slat supporting vision system unit for capturing important documents -- for storage.	
</p>

	<p>LATER VERSIONS OF THIS SLAT TABLE WILL HAVE "UP FROM FLAT SURFACE" AND "CROSS SLAT" DIMENSIONS WHICH WILL SUPPORT CAPTURING OF LARGER DOCUMENTS (8.5 INCHES BY 11 INCHES ETC, ETC).  The "up from flat surface" dimension will be 15 inches (more than likely) or better.	
</p>

	<p>One can start by producing 3 slats, 1 and 7/8 inches wide by 21 inches long by 1/2 inch (osb thickness) thick.  One will then shorten the table surface slat to 8 or 9 inches or so, while leaving the other 2 slats as they are.	
</p>

	<p>The center of the vision unit will not be precisely 5 inches in from the "vertical slat edge".  Vision unit manufacturers will vary their designs to their liking, and anomolies will be ever present.  The center of the vision unit lens should roughly be 6 inches (plus or minus) in from the slat table's navel edge.	
</p>

	<p>This should help capture these documents efficiently.
